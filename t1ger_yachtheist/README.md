### Config.ProgressBars
- Disable Config.ProgressBars if you want to use your own or just deactive it.

### Config.DatabaseItems
- Make sure the items you've added in your database matches exactly this config table.
- Only change the right side, example: ['drill'] = 'drill'
- Edited: ['drill'] = 'machine'
- So right side is the name of the item in your database.

### MLO 
- Make sure to extract the yachtheist.rar in the [MLO] folder and install it in your stream folder & resource folder.
- MAKE SURE TO MOVE THE STREAM MLO OUT OF THE SCRIPT FOLDER!!
