### Car List
- Add all the cars you want in Config.ScrapVehicles
- Script will scramble Config.ChopShop.Settings.carListAmount for every Config.ChopShop.Settings.newCarListTimer

### Materials
- Add or remove materials, configure chance, min/max amount etc. 
- Make sure to edit to weight in SQL if u are using weight system, otherwise u will get an error when running the SQL.

### Scrapping Owned Vehicles
- In config enable/disable scrapping owned vehicles

### GCPHONE / PHONE MESSAGES
- By default my script supports GCPhone with phone messages. 
- In utils.lua find this function: JobNotifyMSG
- TriggerServerEvent('gcPhone:sendMessage', phoneNr, msg) - is the event that sends the message. 
- If u have white screen issue, then your GCPHONE is messed up somehow, in that case have a look here and maybe use this version: https://forum.cfx.re/t/solved-gcphone-white-screen-issue/716438
- Again, this is an extra feature, i do not support your GCPHONE being fucked up.
